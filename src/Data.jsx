    {question : "What is React?",
     answar : "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and render when the data changes."},
    {question : "What is JSX in React?",
     answar : "JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React. It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and render UI components."},
    {question : "Explain the Virtual DOM in React.",
     answar : "The Virtual DOM is a concept in React where a lightweight representation of the actual DOM is maintained. React uses this representation to efficiently update and render the real DOM when there are changes, improving performance."},
    {question : "What is a component in React?",
     answar : "A component in React is a reusable and self-contained piece of UI that can be composed to build complex user interfaces. Components can be either functional (using functions) or class-based (using ES6 classes)."},
    {question : "What are props in React?",
     answar : "Props (short for properties) are a mechanism for passing data from parent to child components in React. They are immutable and help make components reusable and customizable."},
    {question : "What is state in React?",
     answar : "State is a built-in feature in React that allows components to store and manage their own data. It enables a component to re-render when its state changes."},
    {question : "What is the key prop used for in React lists?",
     answar : "The key prop is used to give a unique identifier to each item in a list of elements. It helps React efficiently update the DOM when items are added, removed, or rearranged in the list."},
    {question : "What is the purpose of the setState method in React?",
     answar : "The setState method is used to update the state of a React component. It is essential for triggering re-renders and ensuring that the UI reflects the latest data."},
    {question : "Explain the concept of event handling in React.",
     answar : "Event handling in React involves defining event handlers (functions) to respond to user interactions, such as clicks or input changes. These handlers are assigned to specific elements in the JSX using attributes like onClick or onChange."},
    {question : "What is a controlled component in React?",
     answar : "A controlled component is a form element (like an input field or textarea) whose value is controlled by React's state. Changes to the input are handled through state, making it easy to manage and validate user input."},
